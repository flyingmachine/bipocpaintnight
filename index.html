    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>What if I'm not an artist?</em><br/>
        Doesn't matter! Just think of it as playing with paint.
        Anybody can play with paint. We're just here to have fun.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <em>Can I bring my own project to work on?</em><br/>
        Absolutely! And it doesn't have to be painting. It could be
        drawing or collage or whatever. Just bring it and have a good
        time with us.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <em>Can I show up late?</em><br/>
        You can show up any time between 7pm and 9pm!
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>Can I bring alcoholic beverages?</em><br/>
        Yes! Any food or drinks are welcome. All alcohol must stay inside the building.
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>What will we be painting?</em><br />
        
        That's completely up to you! I think that as kids we were able to
        experience the joy of just putting paint on stuff, and I’m hoping that
        this will be a way for people to reconnect with that.

        <p>That being said, everyone is welcome to choose a subject
        beforehand and ask others for help. I’m pretty sure there will be
          experienced artists there who can offer advice.</p>
